# BBCA Stock Valuation Expert System  

This project is a **rule-based expert system** for valuing **BBCA (Bank Central Asia) stock price**, built using the **CLIPS programming language**. It integrates a **certainty factor** mechanism to handle uncertainty in stock valuation decisions.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
- Utilizes **rule-based logic** to analyze stock valuation criteria.  
- Implements **expert system principles** to provide a structured decision-making approach.  
- **Integrated with Certainty Factor (CF)** to quantify confidence levels in stock price evaluations.  
- Written in **CLIPS**, a programming language designed for building expert systems.  

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage  
1. Install **CLIPS** from [here](http://www.clipsrules.net/).  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonRafaelLovelyno/bbca-expert-system.git  
   cd bbca-expert-system  
   ```  
3. Run the CLIPS environment:  
   ```bash
   clips  
   ```  
4. Load the expert system file:  
   ```clips
   (load "BBCA Expert System with Certainty Factor.clp")  
   ```  
5. Run the expert system:  
   ```clips
   (reset)  
   (run)  
   ```  

## ðŸ“Š Features  
- **Rule-based reasoning** for stock price valuation.  
- **Inference engine** to evaluate BBCA stock conditions.  
- **Certainty Factor (CF) integration** to measure confidence levels in stock assessments.  
- **Structured knowledge representation** in CLIPS.  

## ðŸ“Ž Notes  
- This project is built **exclusively for learning purposes** and does not provide financial advice.  
- CLIPS is a **declarative** programming language optimized for **expert systems**.
